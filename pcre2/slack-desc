# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

pcre2:
pcre2: The PCRE library is a set of functions that implement regular
pcre2: expression pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as
pcre2: Perl 5. PCRE has its own native API, as well as a set of wrapper
pcre2: functions that correspond to the POSIX regular expression API.

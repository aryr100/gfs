# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libnice: libnice (The GLib ICE implementation)
libnice:
libnice: Libnice is an implementation of the IETF's Interactive Connectivity
libnice: Establishment (ICE) standard (RFC 5245) and the Session Traversal
libnice: Utilities for NAT (STUN) standard (RFC 5389). It provides a
libnice: GLib-based library, libnice and a Glib-free library, libstun as well
libnice: as GStreamer elements. ICE is useful for applications that want to
libnice: establish peer-to-peer UDP data streams. It automates the process of
libnice: traversing NATs and provides security against some attacks. It also
libnice: allows applications to create reliable streams using a TCP over UDP
libnice: layer. Existing standards that use ICE include Session Initiation
libnice: Protocol (SIP) and XMPP Jingle.
